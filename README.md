This repository contains a LaTeX template for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science final project report at **California State University, Dominguez Hills**. It includes sections such as a title page, approval page, acknowledgements, abstract, table of contents, and structured content areas like methodology, discussion, and future work.

## üìÅ Structure

- `template_final_report.tex`: Main LaTeX source file
- `cover_page.pdf`: (Optional) Custom cover page (commented in the source)
- `figures/`: Folder for images and diagrams (if used)
- `bin/`: Directory for intermediate files (created during compilation)
- `build.bat`: Windows batch file for building the report
- `Makefile`: Makefile for building the report on macOS/Linux

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you want to include a custom cover page, add the cover_page.pdf to the root directory and uncomment the line in `template_final_report.tex` that includes it.

## üìå Features

- Clean, professional layout following academic formatting standards
- Automatic table of contents, list of figures, and list of tables
- Custom headers and page numbering
- Section/subsection styling for improved readability
- Code listings with syntax highlighting (via `listings` package)
- PDF embedding for external documents

## üöÄ Building the PDF

You can build the report using the CLI. Intermediate files will be placed in the bin/ directory, and the final PDF will appear in the root.

### üîß macOS & Linux (with make)

```bash
make
```
To clean intermediate files:

```bash
make clean
```

### üîß Windows (with PowerShell)

```powershell
build.bat
```
To clean intermediate files:

```powershell
build.bat clean
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual Compilation (All OS)

If you'd like to compile manually using pdflatex:
```bash
mkdir -p bin
pdflatex -output-directory=bin template_final_report.tex
mv bin/template_final_report.pdf .
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace mv with move on Windows.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Customization

Update the following in report.tex:

- Project_Title, Your_First_Name Your_Last_Name
